## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
N <- 10 
storage <- rep(NA, N)
storage

for (i in 2:N){
  storage[i] <- i^2
  cat("i =", i, " and i^2 =", i^2, " was saved in storage[", i, "]\n")
}

storage
```

```{r}
n <- 10000
Xi <- rep(seq(30, 100, length.out=n/2), each=2) #n must be even.
Yi <- 2.5 + 3*Xi + rnorm(n, 0, 1.2)
```

```{r}
storage <- rep(NA, n)
for (i in 1:n){
  Xi <- rep(seq(30, 100, length.out=n/2), each=2) #n must be even.
  Yi <- 2.5 + 3*Xi + rnorm(n, 0, 1.2)
  mylm <- lm(Yi ~ Xi)
  storage[i] <- coef(mylm)[1] #intercept only
}
hist(storage)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
